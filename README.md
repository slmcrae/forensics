# Forecasting Utilization Rates for the Victoria Police Forensic Services Centre

### Overview

The Victoria Police Forensic Services Centre maintains a database that contains the case numbers of samples
that have been submitted for forensic testing along with their associated offence categories. Different types
of offense categories typically require the services of different sectors of the centre. 

The purpose of this project was to forecast the workloads of the different forensic service sectors. To achieve
this, it was assumed that the offense category was equivalent to the business sector. Utilization rates were 
calculated by dividing the number of cases in the Forensic Services Centre database with the total number of 
cases in Victoria.

Forecast models were produced using SAS procedures. 

### Data Overview

The Victoria Police Forensic Services Centre offers a range of forensic testing to support police investigations. 
Requests for services are entered onto a database. Select information from these requests are collated into a summary 
table in SAS. Each observation in the table represents one request and includes information such as; request type, 
case number, container number, item number, creating unit, request start and end dates, and associated offence category. 
Each week the table is updated, and the number of observations increases.  During this project, there were just over one 
million rows with requests dating back to 2005. 

The summary table has the potential to provide insight into trends occurring across different groups in the department 
and assist in decision making with regards to budgets, planning and resource allocation. 

The raw data is confidential and therefore not able to be published publicly.
